The vibrational analysis of the sensor board was conducted using Adobe Inventor and Nastran. The analysis conducted worked to ensure the sensor board would survive 
similar environments to that onboard the payload of a satelite. The analysis also investigated the natural frequency of the board and the key areas of stress experienced
due to the boards vibrations.
